Though PG&E has done this with great finesse, the real impact of its political control has been to rob the city of hundreds of millions of dollars over most of this century. It has done chis by using whatever means it has felt necessary to prevent the city from taking control of its own electrical power-as was originally required by a 1913 federal law (the Raker Ace) and a 1939 U.S. Supreme Court decision-and, I believe, by defrauding the city of tens of millions of dollars in potential fees for delivering electrical power to its customers.</p><p>The most horrific aspect of chis fraud has been the complicity of city politicians at every step along the way. The story begins before the 1906 San Francisto earthquake, when the Spring Valley Water Company held a monopoly to provide water to the city. With population growth it became apparent that a new citywide water system was needed, one with adequate water supplies. However, a new sense of urgency materialized with the devastating fires-which were partly the result of Spring Valley’s cheap construction-following the 1906 earthquake. Searching for additional water sources, the city found the Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park and devised a plan to dam the valley and pipe the water the 189 miles to San Francisco.</p><p>The plan was finally approved in 1913 when Congressman John Raker introduced legislation to let San Francisto build the dam. The conditions, which have been in effect since then, srate that the dam must also be used to generate electricity, which then must be sold directly to the citizens at the lowest possible rates through a municipal power agency. The Raker Act also states that if the city fails to meet these requirements, the Hetch Hetchy grant reverts to the federal government.</p><p>After the dam was completed in 1923, the city revoked its franchise to Spring Valley for water and created its own municipal water system. It also began building transmission lines to carry power to the city, but in 1925 it ran out of money, conveniently, just a few hundred yards away from a PG&E substation and high-voltage cable. As a “temporary” measure, the city decided to sell Hetch Hetchy power to PG&E at wholesale; PG&E would then sell the power to its San Francisto customers at retail. PG&E paid the city a small franchise fee for use of city streets and easements and pocketed the profits on the retail cost of the electricity.This marked the beginning of PG&E’s takeover of San Francisto power and of a 70-year violation by the utility and city officials of the conditions of the Raker Act. In 1927, San Francisto supervisors placed a bond measure on the ballot to buy the equipment needed to establish municipal power. PG&E vehemently fought the measure, which failed. At this point the federal government stepped in, demanding that the city enforce the Raker Act.</p><p>Another bond measure was placed on the ballot, and again PG&E was successful, convincing voters that the bond measure and municipal power would raise taxes. This happened time and time again over the years, until a federal judge ruled that the city’s contracts with PG&E violated the Raker Act’s ban on the sale of power to a private corporation. In 1939, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld this ruling.</p><p>As was typical for the era, both the San Francisto Chronicle and the Examiner ran editorials on behalf of PG&E and against the Supreme Court ruling. For the next several years the battle between the federal government and the city over the PG&E contracts continued. It’s been a story of failed bond measures, attempts by the federal government to enforce compliance, delaying tactics by city officials in implementing public power, and multidecade contracts with PG&E. In 1972, a group of pro bono CPAs, Accountants for the Public Interest, conducted a study and discovered chat the city could profit by $22 million annually, after costs, by buying out PG&E service in San Francisto and municipalizing the delivery of power to city residents. The next year, a civil grand jury investigated the Raker Act and the contracts with PG&E and concluded that public power was required by law. Nothing came of it.</p><p>Finally, in 1982, a citizens’ group known as San Franciscans for Public Power was able to place an initiative on the ballot calling for a study of the feasibility of public power. This measure was defeated after PG&E spent more than $600,000 to oppose it, with the help of then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein. With the specter of a feasibility study out of the way, PG&E immediately attempted to raise the rates that it charged the city both for use of PG&E’s power lines to provide the city’s own power to public buildings and for backup of the city’s power supply when low water levels cut the city’s power production at Hetch-Hetchy.</p><p>In late 1987, Mayor-elect Art Agnos, who’d formerly been pro-public power, was summoned by PG&E head Dick Clarke, who told Agnos that the contracts with PG&E could not be discontinued and that PG&E had all the votes it needed on the board of supervisors to prevent public power in San Francisco. According to The San Francisto Bay Guardian, Agnos was also told that if he didn’t want to play ball, PG&E would “crush his political career.” The next year, the Guardian released its own analysis, in which it found that the city was losing more than $150 million each year to PG&E by failing to comply with the Raker Act and establish a municipal utility. Later that year the board voted eight to three to go along with PG&E for the next 27 years, even though this agreement—like all the contracts that have preceded it—is in violation of federal law.</p><p>Agnos, perhaps seeing the political writing on the wall, signed the contract. This occurred even after the city’s budget analyst reported that the contracts were a bad deal, and a violation of standard city procedures, even going so far as to recommend that the supervisors oppose the contracts.I became actively involved in the public power debate soon after I took office and, with then-supervisor Terence Hallinan, coauthored a resolution allocating $50,000 for the long-sought-after feasibility study. It passed and was to become effective in early 1991. Agnos wouldn’t sign the resolution, nor did he include the funding for it in the 1992-1993 budget. The study was never performed. As had been i:he case since 1927, PG&E was behind the scenes, killing the effort.</p><p>In 1994, as president of the board, I established a select committee of the board on the municipalization of public power. I then made a motion for $150,000 to produce a feasibility study on the municipalization of power. The vote was seven to three in favor but, as Art Agnos had done before him, Frank Jordan refused the funding. This time we didn’t even have the eight votes necessary to override his refusal.</p><p>The next year, 1995, I decided to try again. This time I authored an ordinance modifying the administrative code to require the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to “author and submit to the board by June 30, 1996, a report regarding the feasibility of municipalizing the city’s utilities distribution system in San Francisco.” The ordinance also stated that “willful failure to discharge such duties would be deemed official misconduct.” Again I included a request for $150,000 for the study. This time, the ordinance was approved by the board on an eight-to-two vote. The mayor refused to sign it, but the ordinance became law in April. Even though a feasibility study performed for Chicago had cost over a million dollars, this small figure of $150,000 was the best we could do. In a coincidental twist of fate, however, this request for supplemental allocation, which left the controller’s office on May 12, took 11 days to reach the mayor’s budget director—five days too late to be included in the city’s 1995-1996 budget. Obviously, the long trip between two offices in the same building was fraught with unforeseen hazards.</p><figure class="quote lg:hidden text-xl font-playfair pl-10 lg:pr-0 border-l border-red py-10 my-5 max-w-[70ch]"><blockquote class="text-red">"As America Disneyfies itself for the millennium, Angela Alioto tells a wonderful story of how politics could be -- without the scripted sound bites. The cold, the fear and the pain of real life -- it is all here."</blockquote><figcaption class="mt-5">&mdash; Governor Jerry Brown"</figcaption></figure><p>I was so angry that I made a board motion to add $150,000 back to Hetch Hetchy’s budget and shift those funds to pay for the feasibility study. With an eight-to-three vote in favor of my motion, the mayor’s support was unnecessary, and the study could finally move forward.</p><p>The PUC had voted repeatedly to oppose any funding for a feasibility study. It was only after the board passed legislation requiring a study that the PUC reluctantly complied, and issued a request for proposals from independent consultants.</p><p>When the bids came in, the PUC scored the competing consultants on a number of categories. These numbers were then rallied, and the bidder with the highest score was to be awarded the contract. When the PUC revealed its final choice, it was discovered by The San Francisto Bay Guardian and San Franciscans for Public Power that the contract was being given to Phillip Muller of Strategic Energy Limited (SEL)-a man who’d been a PG&E executive for 13 years. In an interview with the Guardian, Muller claimed that his experience with PG&E would be helpful because, he said, “I know PG&E and I know the people and I know the institution, so I can ask the right questions and get the information.” Joel Ventresca of San Franciscans for Public Power saw it differently, suggesting dryly, “He’s got PG&E’s fingerprints all over him.” I immediately called for a special meeting of the select committee on municipal public power to investigate possible conflicts of interest in awarding the contract. I also asked for the test results, which would show how each consultant had scored. The fight for municipal power had been going on for 70 years, and some people in the city, like Bruce Brugmann at the Guardian, had been fighting for decades just for the opportunity to have a feasibility study conducted; I wasn’t about to see PG&E and its lackeys win yet another victory by controlling the results in advance.</p><p>Before the select committee, it came out that Muller had received a substantial bonus as well as a future pension from PG&E when he left the company. Moreover, though SEL had scored highest, another potential conflict was apparent. The test results had clearly been tampered with. Under the “experience” category, one of the four PUC members scoring the bidders gave a zero to the second-place company, Economic and Technical Analysis Group (ETAG), effectively lowering its overall score. Yet ETAG had experience conducting other feasibility studies—though, admittedly, none of this specific type. In questioning the PUC members, both Supervisor Sue Bierman and I were unsatisfied with the answers we received. Larry Klein, the Hetch Hetchy executive director, refused to identify the member who gave ETAG the zero score.</p><p>I followed this up by introducing a pair of resolutions at the board to demand revocation of the contract and to force the PUC to identify the names of the raters on each evaluation scoring sheet.</p><p>I was also angered that the original bid guidelines seemed biased against public power. For example, the city’s request for proposals failed even to include a demand that bidders study the Hetch Hetchy power system and the Raker Act public power mandate. I authored a policy resolution urging the mayor to demand that the PUC immediately terminate the contract with SEL and review and reevaluate the contractor selection process. The resolution was approved by the board and, this time, signed by Mayor Jordan. A review committee was established, composed of both proponents and opponents of public power. Finally, on May 6, 1996, the review committee recommended hiring J. W. Wilson & Associates, which scored on the revised evaluation 133 points ahead of ETAG, the next closest bidder. But the story didn’t end there. I was informed that on the PUC’s upcoming meeting agenda was an item calling for the award of the contract to one of the bidders. Although Wilson & Associates had already been recommended by the review committee, the PUC decided to choose ETAG, and we were back where we had been six months before. Though I’d been angered at the earlier selection of SEL the previous fall, I was now more incensed by the PUC’s selection of ETAG over the review committee’s recommended choice — Wilson & Associates.</p><p>I went back to the board with another piece of legislation, calling for the mayor to urge the PUC not to sign the ETAG contract because of conflict of interest and—as we’ll soon see—its ties to PG&E. The legislation went into effect without the signature of the mayor. Subsequently, Mayor Brown did nothing to implement it.</p><p>I wasn’t just being a picky consumer, always looking for a better choice. Not only had the PUC ignored the review committee’s clear choice of Wilson & Associates, but the irregularities in this new selection process had gone too far. First, Larry Klein and Anson Moran, the PUC manager, had refused to disqualify ETAG even after the consultant belatedly disclosed that it had done at least $140,000 worth of work for PG&E in the past. Second, the PUC never obtained a deposition that ETAG’s project manager had given on behalf of PG&E in 1988 and that proved ETAG’s bias toward PG&E and its opposition to public power. Third, the PUC did not require that ETAG provide examples of completed municipalization feasibility studies, a minimum standard required for any qualified bidder. Fourth, none of the examples that ETAG gave of its studies, including a confidential report, were public power feasibility studies or in any way comparable to the proposed San Francisto study. Fifth, Larry Klein gave the PUC an information packet containing a trade journal article critical of Wilson & Associates, but provided no other details of the review committee’s discussions. Sixth, the protest that was filed by Wilson & Associates was reviewed by the PUC only in closed sessions. And finally, Larry Klein refused to disclose why the PUC rejected the protest by Wilson & Associates, claiming that the PUC’s rejection was decided in secret meetings and he could not disclose what the PUC commissioners had discussed. Even with all the testimony, I still had no verifiable proof that ETAG had been selected over Wilson & Associates for shady reasons. But Joel Ventresca pointed out that “this illogical decision smacks of backroom politicking; in my 25 years of activism in San Francisto I’ve never seen such an arrogant abuse of power by a city commission.”</p><p>By now it had become apparent that the only choice left for me was to attempt to take away from the PUC the $150,000 the board had allocated them for the study. I asked the deputy city attorney for advice on this. He told me that since the PUC’s decision had not yet been finalized, under the city’s new charter I could draft a resolution setting up a procedure to select another consultant.</p><p>Throughout the long ordeal of trying to select a consultant, it had become obvious that to win, all the anti-public power faction had to do was to keep stalling. Term limits meant that I’d be long gone before any feasibility study was ever completed, or even before they selected a consultant.</p><p>With the new rubber-stamp board of supervisors, and with the mayor’s office firmly in PG&E’s pocket (as most other mayors have been since 1927), the likelihood of public power, with its multimillion-dollar windfall for the city, remains only a distant hope. Although several battles were won, over the years PG&E has been able to control the war over public power every step of the way. It has used the city’s own paid staff to try to block every effort to stop the powerful utility monopoly from continuing to steal from San Francisco residents. In all of these hearings, PG&E has never had to send a representative or mount its own defense. In the war over public power, PG&E has been able to use the city’s own PUC, Hetch Hetchy Project Manager Larry Klein, and even PUC Manager Anson Moran as its private lackeys. And in many instances over the past few years, it has also successfully used the mayor’s office and members of the board of supervisors.</p><p>An armored-truck robbery, bad guys’ guns blazing, might be of more visceral interest to the media. But in scope, it would pale in comparison.One of the costs of not having public power in San Francisco is having to put up with PG&E’s continual deceit over the franchise fee that it is required to pay the city to deliver consumer power over public property. The fee was set in 1939 at .5% of gross electricity sales. In reviewing similar fees in other cities, we found that the average electricity franchise fee is 4%-eight times what San Francisco has been getting for nearly 60 years.</p><p>In 1994 I wrote a piece of legislation that would have raised the electricity franchise fee rate to 2% in 1995 and to the national average of 4% between 1996 and 1999. The budget analyst estimated that an increase to 2% would generate annual revenues of $8.5 million, and the increase to 4% would generate $21 million. My strongest ally on this, as usual, was Supervisor Terence Hallinan.</p><p>The lobbying against this legislation was awesome. Nevertheless, no opposing argument made any sense. The board passed it and Mayor Jordan signed it. After it was signed, PG&E claimed that the new regulation was illegal because the original 1939 agreement supposedly contained an “in-perpetuity” clause. We went downstairs to the city’s dusty contract vault to look for the suddenly revealed clause. Not surprisingly, there was no such clause in the contract.</p><p>The select committee then discovered that PG&E had been supplying the Presidio military base with power since 1939 without ever having paid the city a franchise fee. This period included World War II, and the Korean and Vietnam Wars—periods when the Presidio was operating at its full military potential and using vast quantities of electricity. We checked the records and discovered that the city knew of this violation as early as 1941. The city attorney at that time had even ruled PG&E’s actions illegal. Yet no money had ever been paid to the city for these 50 years. Nor had the city ever actively attempted to collect.</p><p>PG&E prodded their well-oiled litigation machinery into action. They moved to sue the city to block our attempt to collect the millions of dollars in unpaid franchise fees. Figuring they might as well kill two birds with one trip to the courthouse, they also sued to prevent any further efforts on our part to raise fees. Seeing no other choice, the select committee and the board instructed the city attorney’s office to sue PG&E for failing to pay the city money it has been owed for more than half a century and for trespassing on public property.</p><p>PG&E knew what the public power advocates were up to. If we could establish a public power beachhead at the Presidio, we might be able eventually to achieve public power for the entire city.</p><p>With the ownership of the Presidio shifting to the National Park Service, we wanted to provide the city with an opportunity to bid on supplying power. Meanwhile the Park Service had paid PG&E $80,000 to study the Presidio’s electrical system, and PG&E had announced that upgrading the system would cost almost $23 million. PG&E told the Park Service that for that amount, they would gladly take the Presidio’s electrical system off their hands—which they did. That’s when we jumped into the picture, alleging that PG&E had an impermissible conflict of interest and that a competitive bidding process should be followed. The Park Service decided to accept bids. Four groups entered the fray: the city, PG&E, a group called Women’s Energy, and San Franciscans for Public Power. Faced with competition, PG&E informed the Park Service that it could upgrade the Presidio’s power system at no cost to the Park Service— and returned the original $23 million. As in the Motorola case, this stresses the importance of a competitive bidding process. Competitive bidding always keeps quality and efficiency high and price low.</p><p>Guess who won the contract/ When San Francisto lost the bid, the city protested and filed a lawsuit.</p><p>All bidders who were not selected administratively filed protests. In 1995, the U.S. Controller’s Office ruled against both the city’s appeal and the one filed by Women’s Energy and San Franciscans for Public Power. The city immediately filed suit in federal court to appeal the decision because, in its request for proposals, the Park Service specifically required the bidder to have a franchise license to deliver gas and electricity to the Presidio. We contended that PG&E had never had such a license and had not paid the franchise fee in 55 years. We also contended that federal competitive bidding forbids agencies such as the Park Service from awarding contracts to anyone performing systems engineering work or providing technical direction for the system, as PG&E had done.</p><p>We’re still waiting.</p><p>Opponents of public power claim that the city doesn’t have the expertise to manage a municipal power system in San Francisco. For nearly 70 years, PG&E and its lobbyists have successfully convinced voters that the city is unreliable and that if it can’t even fix potholes, it certainly can’t manage power. But PG&E service has continued to decline at the same time that its rates to consumers are among the highest in the nation. What people don’t know is that the city has been providing its own power, with very few maintenance problems, to 1,370 city buildings, our public transportation system, the Port of San Francisco, and the airport for decades, saving millions of dollars for local taxpayers and benefiting the general fund every year. The general fund is like the private bank account of the citizens of a city—it is an important source of local funding.</p><p>Opponents also don’t realize that cities from Los Angeles to Sacramento have municipal power. Why have these facts been kept secret when the whole city could be on public power for less cost to the consumer and more money to the general fund? The answer, please: PG&E, which has made hundreds of millions of dollars on the existing arrangement, and local politicians who have been either too crooked or too fearful or too lazy to fight this giant monopoly. This information is not mere campaign rhetoric. If I based a political campaign on PG&E material, voters would fall asleep. PG&E has made sure that few people care. But the simple fact of the matter is that PG&E owes a great deal of money to San Francisco, and they should no longer be permitted to continue merrily along with not paying what they owe the city, and therefore the people, of San Francisco.</p><p>This is about more than some cranky people in California demanding changes to an obscure system. It’s a blistering example of how government is no longer owned by its citizens—if it ever was. In January 1996, when I was running against John Burton for the California State Senate, I was informed by Stan Smith of the San Francisco Labor Council that I would not be considered for the council’s endorsement. As it turned out, there was a little-known resolution prohibiting the council from considering any candidate who supported public power. I was informed of this only three days prior to the endorsement meeting, so I had little chance to gather support. I was told that I might as well not even show up at the meeting.</p><p>So PG&E, along with the political machine, was setting in motion the mechanism to keep me from office.One of the key member groups in the San Francisco Labor Council is the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), the union representing PG&E employees. Stan Smith’s wife is Kathy Maas, business manager of the IBEW. PG&E had convinced the union that public power was not in their best interest. Maas reported that her union was against public power because, as she said, “I don’t believe that the city and county of San Francisco could or would be as good an employer as PG&E.”</p><p>I’ve been an advocate for public power my entire elected life, but I’ve also been a strong union supporter at the same time. My father was a staunchly pro-union mayor, and I believe in the rights of the working men and women; but union members aren’t always told what the union leadership is up to.I showed up at the endorsement meeting anyway, and was told that I couldn’t speak because of the rules against endorsing anyone who advocates public power—even though the IBEW had already endorsed me. I’d been endorsed by both labor and the electrical union specifically for eight years, and now, suddenly, this rule was being imposed. Running against Willie Brown had been bad, but it was nothing compared to running against PG&E.</p><p>The council finally let me speak. I explained how public power could save millions of dollars, which could be channeled into better worker benefits. I pointed out PG&E’s history of corporate downsizing and its firing of 3,000 employees two years before, none of whom had received severance pay or health benefits. I drew attention to labor’s endorsement that evening for Supervisors Carole Migden and Kevin Shelley, both of whom had supported public power. Somehow the pro-public-power voting record of these candidates didn’t get in their way. But then, neither of them had fought as hard as I had for public power. Neither of them had created and chaired the select committee on municipal public power. Neither of them had taken on PG&E over the issue of the franchise fees. And neither of them had gone up against the PUC to ensure the independence of a feasibility study for public power.</p><p>Maybe I should have taken heed of Dick Clarke’s warning to Art Agnos about playing ball.That night it became obvious to me that PG&E and the Burton-Brown machine were in bed together. PG&E had just donated over $100,000 for Willie Brown’s mayoral inauguration party. Brown later named Dick Clarke the head of his spring 1996 economic summit.</p><br><p>***</p></div></div></div><div class="lg:w-1/3"><img class="h-96 object-cover lg:h-auto" src="img/AngelaAlioto_GoldenGate@593.webp" srcset="img/AngelaAlioto_GoldenGate@297.webp 297w, img/AngelaAlioto_GoldenGate@445.webp 445w, img/AngelaAlioto_GoldenGate@593.webp 593w, img/AngelaAlioto_GoldenGate@1186.webp 1186w, img/AngelaAlioto_GoldenGate@1779.webp 1779w" alt="alt" sizes="100vw, (min-width: 594px) 593px, (min-width: 1024px) 34vw" width="593" height="772"><div class="mt-10 max-w-max"><nav class="main-nav gap-y-5 hidden lg:grid"><a class="transition-all duration-300 inline-grid place-items-center leading-tight px-3 py-5 text-lg rounded text-center hover:text-red" href="/">Home</a><a class="transition-all duration-300 inline-grid place-items-center leading-tight px-3 py-5 text-lg rounded text-center hover:text-red" href="foreword-by-coppola.html">Foreword by Francis Ford Coppola</a><a class="transition-all duration-300 inline-grid place-items-center leading-tight px-3 py-5 text-lg rounded text-center hover:text-red" href="https://knightsofsaintfrancis.myshopify.com/cart/42125551927464:1?channel=buy_button" target="_blank">Ask for Complimentary Copy</a></nav></div><figure class="quote hidden lg:block text-xl mt-[100vh] min-w-min font-playfair pl-10 lg:pr-10 xl:pr-16 2xl:pr-20 border-l border-red py-10"><blockquote class="text-red">"As America Disneyfies itself for the millennium, Angela Alioto tells a wonderful story of how politics could be -- without the scripted sound bites.
